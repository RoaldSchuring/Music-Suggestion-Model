### Introduction

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook outlining the various steps to build a simple music recommendation algorithm in Python. 


### Prerequisites

#### Data

The dependent variable in this model is song ratings from my personal profile on the Radio Paradise website (www.radioparadise.com). You may either import your own song ratings (simply copy-paste the song ratings from your personal profile on RP), or use my personal ratings. These have been attached to the repository in the file 'song_ratings.csv'.

The features in the model are song tags taken from the LastFM Million Song Dataset:

Last.fm dataset, the official song tags and song similarity collection for the Million Song Dataset, available at: http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/lastfm

Since the raw data was too large to attach to this repository, you will need to use the link above to download the various JSON files for all the songs. Store these locally and make sure that the path referencing these files in the Notebook is adjusted to match this location.


#### Packages

The necessary packages have been listed out in the accompanying requirements.txt file.


### Instructions

Once the data and required packages have been installed, you should be able to run the notebook from start to finish.
